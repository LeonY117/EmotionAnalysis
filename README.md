# Emotion Analysis

### What's in this repo

**Demo**: The main demo notebook is in `notebooks/demo.ipynb`. The notebook loads some testing data and a trained network, and shows some quantitative & qualitative examples.

**Data**: You can find the raw data in `data/raw` and the processed up data (which we use for training) in `data/clean`. Code used for preprocessing can be found in `notebooks/preprocess.ipynb`

**Training**: Everything we've done to obtain our results are contained within `notebooks/main.ipynb`. The notebook is well documented with a clear structure, and you can also choose to run training from the notebook.
