53:53	H:H	H:H	We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives.
54:54	N:N	H:H	In our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one.
55:55	N:N	N:N	So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night.
56:56	N:N	N:N	We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories.
57:57	N:H	N:H	My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented.

63:63	N:N	N:-	He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart.

65:65	N:N	N:A	He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room.
66:66	N:F	N:F	I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning.
67:67	N:N	N:F	When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak.

99:99	N:N	N:N	He went to travel, and before he started he placed a gold ring on my finger; and as soon as he was out of the house, my mistress sent for me.

101:101	N:N	N:N	She showed me clearly, in spirit and in truth, the difference there was between him and me.

113:113	Sa:N	S:S	I passed through a dreadful night; God knows what I suffered, and how I struggled.
114:114	N:N	S:S	The following Sunday I went to the house of God to pray for light to direct my path.

116:116	N:N	N:S	We were suited to each other in rank and circumstances.
117:117	N:N	N:S	He was, even then, a man of good means.
118:118	H:N	H:S	I went up to him, and took his hand, and said, 'Do you still feel the same for me?' 'Yes; ever and always,' said he.
119:119	H:N	H:N	'Will you, then, marry a maiden who honors and esteems you, although she cannot offer you her love? but that may come.' 'Yes, it will come,' said he; and we joined our hands together, and I went home to my mistress.

121:121	N:N	N:-	I could not place it on my finger during the daytime, but only in the evening, when I went to bed.
122:122	N:N	N:S	I kissed the ring till my lips almost bled, and then I gave it to my mistress, and told her that the banns were to be put up for me and the glovemaker the following week.

HCAndersen,the_wind,N:N,N:N,"Late in the autumn, when the days were short, and the mist sprinkled cold drops on the berries and the leafless branches, I came back in fresh spirits, rushed through the air, swept the sky clear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no great labor to do, yet it must be done.
139:139	N:N	N:N	There was another kind of sweeping taking place at Waldemar Daa's, in the castle of Borreby.
140:140	N:N	N:-	His enemy, Owe Ramel, of Basnas, was there, with the mortgage of the house and everything it contained, in his pocket.
141:141	N:N	N:-	I rattled the broken windows, beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled through cracks and crevices, so that Mr. Owe Ramel did not much like to remain there.
142:142	Sa:Sa	S:S	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
143:143	N:N	N:N	Owe Ramel offered Waldemar Daa permission to remain in the house till the end of his life.
144:144	N:N	S:-	No one thanked him for the offer, and I saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head, and throw it back more proudly than ever.
145:145	N:N	N:-	Then I rushed against the house and the old lime-trees with such force, that one of the thickest branches, a decayed one, was broken off, and the branch fell at the entrance, and remained there.
146:146	N:N	N:N	It might have been used as a broom, if any one had wanted to sweep the place out, and a grand sweeping-out there really was; I thought it would be so.
147:147	N:N	S:-	It was hard for any one to preserve composure on such a day; but these people had strong wills, as unbending as their hard fortune.
148:148	N:N	S:-	There was nothing they could call their own, excepting the clothes they wore.
149:149	N:N	N:S	Yes, there was one thing more, an alchymist's glass, a new one, which had been lately bought, and filled with what could be gathered from the ground of the treasure which had promised so much but failed in keeping its promise.
150:150	N:N	S:N	Waldemar Daa hid the glass in his bosom, and, taking his stick in his hand, the once rich gentleman passed with his daughters out of the house of Borreby.
151:151	N:N	S:N	I blew coldly upon his flustered cheeks, I stroked his gray beard and his long white hair, and I sang as well as I was able, 'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r.
152:152	N:N	S:N	Gone away!
153:153	N:N	S:N	Gone away!'
154:154	N:N	S:S	Ida walked on one side of the old man, and Anna Dorothea on the other; Joanna turned round, as they left the entrance.
